# Clean Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This project follows Clean Architecture principles with a feature-first approach, ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (UI)
- **Location**: `lib/features/{feature}/presentation/`
- **Responsibility**: UI components, state management, user interactions
- **Components**: Pages, Widgets, Controllers, Providers

### 2. Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- **Location**: `lib/features/{feature}/domain/`
- **Responsibility**: Business rules, entities, use cases
- **Components**: Entities, Use Cases, Repository Interfaces

### 3. Data Layer (Data Management)
- **Location**: `lib/features/{feature}/data/`
- **Responsibility**: Data operations, external dependencies
- **Components**: Repositories, Data Sources, Models

### 4. Infrastructure Layer (External Services)
- **Location**: `lib/core/infrastructure/`
- **Responsibility**: Firebase, APIs, external services
- **Components**: Firebase Services, API Clients, Storage

## Dependency Flow
```
Presentation → Domain ← Data → Infrastructure
```

## Key Principles
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients don't depend on interfaces they don't use
